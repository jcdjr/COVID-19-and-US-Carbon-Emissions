# How has US Response to COVID-19 impacted measures of carbon emissions?

**Motivation**

“To understand the relationship between changes in economic activity and carbon emissions."     

Like many countries the US responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by issuing strict lockdown orders resulting in an unprecedented decrease in economic activity throughout 2020. This has had devastating social and economic effects on businesses, families, and individuals. However, the response provides an opportunity to identify the changes that made the biggest impact on reducing carbon emissions. For the first time, researchers can analyze these changes using real-world data as opposed to computational models. 

**Initial Questions:**  

How have the sources of carbon emissions changed amid US response to COVID-19?  
How have air quality measures such as N02, C0, Ozone, PM10, PM2.5, and S02 changed?  
What change in economic activity generated the impact on carbon emissions?

# Analysis

**Industrial Trends**

***- Industrial Production Index***

***- Industrial Sector CO2 Emissions***

**Electricity Generation Trends**

***- Fossil Fuel Use in the Electric Power Sector***

***- CO2 Emissions in the Electric Power Sector***

***- Residential Electricity Consumption***

**Transportation Trends**

**Conclusion**

In a comparison of economic sectors, the transportation sector saw the largest drop in CO2 emissions during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdowns in April, 2020. Total CO2 emissions were down 19% in APril. Although emissions data have not been finalized for 2020, climate scientists estimate that total US emmissions will fall by 7% from 2020. This places 2020 as the largest declining year for CO2 emissions since World War II.
