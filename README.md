# Impact of COVID-19 on US Carbon Emissions

**Background**

The 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic prompted countries worldwide to adopt strict containment measures in the form of stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. Due to the unprecedented restrictions on travel and business operations, climate scientists estimate that the global response to COVID-19 will result in 7% decline in carbon emissions. 

**Motivation**

My motivation for investigating this topic is to understand how the response to COVID-19 in the US affected carbon emissions in the industrial, electric power, transportation, and residential sectors. 

**Project Summary**

My capstone project investigates the impact of the response to the pandemic on carbon emissions in the US. Using 19 datasets from sources such as the US Energy Information Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, I compared changes in C02 emissions during the peak of response in April 2020 with C02 emissions in April 2019. 

**Research Questions:**  

How did the response to COVID-19 impact CO2 emissions in the US?

What sector of the US economy saw the largest decrease in CO2 emissions during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown?

How does 2020 compare to previous years where CO2 emissions declined? 

# Research Methods 

**Type of Analysis:** Time Series

**Unit of Analysis:** Economic Sector - Year

**Variables:** US Response to COVID-19 (Indepdent Variable), US CO2 Emissions (Depedent Variable) 

**Conclusion**

In a comparison of economic sectors, the transportation sector saw the largest drop in CO2 emissions during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdowns in April 2020 while the residential sector saw a slight increase. Total CO2 emissions were down 19% in April. Although emissions data have not been finalized for 2020, climate scientists estimate that total US emissions will fall by 7% from 2019. This places 2020 as the largest declining year for CO2 emissions since World War II.
