# Measuring the Impact of COVID-19 on US Carbon Emissions

**Motivation**

“To understand the relationship between changes in economic activity and carbon emissions."     

Like many countries the US responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by issuing strict lockdown orders resulting in an unprecedented decrease in economic activity throughout 2020. This has had devastating social and economic effects on businesses, families, and individuals. However, the response provides an opportunity to identify the changes that made the biggest impact on reducing carbon emissions. For the first time, researchers can analyze these changes using real-world data as opposed to computational models. 

**Research Questions:**  

How did the response to COVID-19 impact CO2 emissions in the US?

What sector of the US economy saw the largest decrease in CO2 emissions during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown?

How does 2020 compare to previous years where CO2 emissions declined?

# Analysis

**Industrial Trends**

***- Industrial Production Index***

***- Industrial Sector CO2 Emissions***

**Electricity Generation Trends**

***- Fossil Fuel Use in the Electric Power Sector***

***- CO2 Emissions in the Electric Power Sector***

***- Residential Electricity Consumption***

**Transportation Trends**

***- TSA Throughput***

***- Airline Fuel Use***

***- POV Vehicle Miles Traveled***

**Conclusion**

In a comparison of economic sectors, the transportation sector saw the largest drop in CO2 emissions during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdowns in April 2020. Total CO2 emissions were down 19% in April. Although emissions data have not been finalized for 2020, climate scientists estimate that total US emissions will fall by 7% from 2020. This places 2020 as the largest declining year for CO2 emissions since World War II.
