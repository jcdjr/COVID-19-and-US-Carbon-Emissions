# How has US' Response to COVID-19 impacted measures of carbon emissions?

**Motivation**

“To guide business and policy making decisions designed to address global climate change.”     
With office buildings being closed during the Covid-19 Pandemic (stagnant water), could this make conditions ripe for a Legionnaires' outbreak?  Is there a correlation between water system violations and increased Legionnaires' cases?

Like many countries, the US States responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by issuing strict lockdown orders resulting in an unprecedented decrease in economic activity throughout 2020. This has had devastating social and economic effects on businesses, families, and individuals. However, the response provides an opportunity to identify the changes which made the biggest impact on reducing carbon emissions. For the first time, researchers can analyze these changes using real-world data as opposed to computational models (Bourzac). 

**Initial Questions:**  

How have the sources of carbon emissions changed amid US response to COVID-19?  
How have air quality measures such as N02, C0, Ozone, PM10, PM2.5, and S02 changed?  
What change in economic activity generated the impact on carbon emissions?
