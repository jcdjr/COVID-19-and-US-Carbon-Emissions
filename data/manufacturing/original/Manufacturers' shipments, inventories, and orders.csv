"p Preliminary 
r Revised data due to late receipts and concurrent seasonal adjustment.  
1 Estimates of shipments and new orders are for the duration of the period, while estimates of unfilled orders and total inventories are for the end of the period. Not seasonally adjusted estimates of shipments and new orders include adjusted data for non-calendar reporters. Seasonally adjusted estimates include concurrent adjustments for holiday and trading-day differences, where appropriate, as well as seasonal variation, based on the results of the latest annual review of the model parameters. Estimates are not adjusted for price changes.        
2 Estimates and percent changes of shipments for the semiconductor industry are included in computers and electronic products, and all other applicable aggregate totals.  
Note:  Estimates of manufacturers' shipments, inventories and orders are subject to survey error and revision.  One major component of survey error is nonsampling error, which includes errors of coverage, response, and nonreporting.  Since the survey panel is not a probability sample, estimates of sampling error cannot be calculated.  For further details on survey design, methodology, and data limitations see <http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/>.
